LITERATE TELEGRAM

demo version 0.1

Right now it's just a few datasets parsed into giant json objects.
I'd like to create a database to represent this stuff.
There is a question of which type of system would be the best for our use case.
Right now, I'm sticking with a MEAN stack for ease of use, but I may want to
check out Postgres in the future.

In any case, right now I just have a basic markov poem bot function spitting
out tweet length strings. I need to rework my datasets into a mongoDB document
collection database. I need a pronunciation model, a word pair model with 
embedded pronunciation, filtered down by the scrabble dictionary to screen out 
all kinds of propper names and so on.

Lets go!
